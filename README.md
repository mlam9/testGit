1) Add README.md file to local repo.

2) In Terminal with current location in the local repo, type 'git add README.md'.
       You can also type 'git add .' to add all new/updated files.

3) In Terminal type 'git commit -m "first commit"'.

4) In Terminal type 'git remote add origin https://github.com/mlam9/x.git'. Where x is the repository that is on github. It helps that the repository on your desktop is the same name as the repository on your github.

5) In Terminal type 'git push -u origin master'. This will push anything added in step 4 to GitHub repo.

6) Anything else that is already in GitHub will undergo Step 2, 3, 5 respectfully.
